AngelHack 2013 
================

Two android applications developed at a 1 day hackathon using Unity. Neocube (refer final3.apk) is a simple 2D side scroller game with a puzzling twist! Really! Match the color blocks shown at the right side of the screen and you'll get bonus points! Just don't fall down.
  Get the highest score and boast in front of your friends.

Other one is a mini go at something like an android application for Resume builder and searcher. (Refer : https://github.com/aymos/Resume-Builder-Searcher - this was developed using web2py) So the application is a android
counterpart of the given web2py app.
